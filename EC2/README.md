## ☁️ What is AWS EC2?

**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** is a web service provided by AWS that offers secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.  
It allows you to run virtual servers (called **instances**) on demand, making it easy to scale applications up or down based on your needs.

**Key Features of AWS EC2:**
- **Variety of Instance Types** – General purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, GPU, etc.
- **Scalability** – Easily increase or decrease capacity.
- **Elastic IPs** – Static IP addresses for your instances.
- **Security** – Control inbound/outbound traffic with Security Groups.
- **Pricing Models** – On-demand, Reserved, Spot, and Savings Plans.

When using Terraform, you can define EC2 instances in `.tf` files and automate their provisioning without logging into the AWS Console.
