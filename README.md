# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

This repository contains examples, best practices, and reusable modules for managing cloud infrastructure using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with **Terraform**.

---

## üìå Introduction

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than manual processes.  
With IaC, you can:
- Version control your infrastructure.
- Automate provisioning and configuration.
- Ensure consistency across environments.

**Terraform** is an open-source IaC tool that enables you to define cloud and on-prem resources using a declarative configuration language (HCL ‚Äì HashiCorp Configuration Language).
